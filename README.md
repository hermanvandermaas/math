Math calculator - normal (infix) and Reverse Polish Notation (postfix)
======================================================================

A JavaScript math calculator script which accepts both infix (normal) mathematical input and postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) input.

Infix notation examples:
2+3\*5=17
3√8+4=6

The same examples in postfix notation:
2 3+ 5\* = 17
3 8√ 4+ = 6

When using normal/infix notation, numbers are separated by the operators (plus, minus etc.).
In postfix notation, numbers are not separated by operators, so there is the need for a separator character, which is a space in this code.
Or calculate the result immediately after entering the operator, in which case a separator character is not needed.
