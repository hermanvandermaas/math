Math calculator - normal (infix) and Reverse Polish Notation (postfix)
======================================================================

A JavaScript math calculator script which accepts both infix (normal) mathematical input and postfix (Reverse Polish Notation) input.

Infix notation example:
2+3\*5=17

The same example in postfix notation:
2 3+ 5\* = 17

When using normal/infix notation, numbers are separated by the operators (plus, minus etc.).
In postfix notation, numbers are not separated by operators, so there is the need for a separator, which is a space in this code.
